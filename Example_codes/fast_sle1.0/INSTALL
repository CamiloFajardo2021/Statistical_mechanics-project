Installation
============

This is not (yet) meant to be a package you can install in the usual
sense. The present version is meant as a starting point for those
who which to do their own SLE simulations with this code.

After you have downloaded fast_sle1.0.tar.gz you should do 

gunzip fast_sle1.0.tar.gz
tar xvf fast_sle1.0.tar

(Of course, if you are reading this file you have probably already
done this.)

There should now be a script run_fast_sle. Execute it.
This will compile the program (driver_sle.c) and run it with some default
parameter values. The parameter values are set in the script, 
and can be changed by modifying the script. See the script for 
documentation.  

See the file README for info doing more than just running the program.
